# 02450 Introduction to Machine Learning academic projects
The 2 projects are elaborated on the [South African Heart Disease dataset](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/datasets/SAheart.info.txt) where different ML concepts were learnd and explored.
In project 1 the following methods for data preparation were used:
- analysing attributes
- summary statistics
- data visualization + PCA analysis
- feature extraction
---
In project 2 the main focus was on analysing the performance of different ML models when it comes to applying them for a regression or a classification problem.<br>
For the regression problem we have analysed 3 models which are: baseline, linear regression with regularization paramter and ANN with the tuning parameter - the number of hidden units.<br>
For the classification problem we have also analysed 3 models: baseline, logistic regression and ANN.
